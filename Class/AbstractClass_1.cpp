Abstract class
Sometimes implementation of all functions cannot be provided in a base class because we donâ€™t know the implementation. Such a class is called an abstract class.

A pure virtual function (or abstract function) in C++ is a virtual function for which we can have an implementation, But we must override that function in the derived class, 
otherwise, the derived class will also become an abstract class. A pure virtual function is declared by assigning 0 in the declaration.

1. A class is abstract if it has at least one pure virtual function.
2. If we do not override the pure virtual function in the derived class, then the derived class also becomes an abstract class.
